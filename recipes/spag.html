    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Well, my lasagna has become quite popular, and I think the sauce from that makes amazing meat sauce as well. So I thought I would post it by itself.</p>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
         <li>1 pound of sweet italian sausage, sliced</li>
         <li>1 cup minced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>2 ounce of tomato paste</li>
         <li>2 ounce cans tomato sauce</li>
         <li>1 cup water</li>
     </ul>
     <h4>Steps</h4>
     <ol>
        <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat, cook the sausage, beef, onion, and garlic until well browned; drain fat. 
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Mix in sugar and season with basil, fennel seed, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.
        Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
     </ol>
