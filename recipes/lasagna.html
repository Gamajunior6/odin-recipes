    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chocolate-covered strawberries are simple but oh-so-delicious.
     You can easily heat your chocolate and shortening in the microwave, then dunk your strawberries in the decadent mixture.
     Finish the strawberries off with a little white chocolate drizzle for a fancy touch.</p>
